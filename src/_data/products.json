				"text": "This new iPad Air, on the surface, isn't anything groundbreaking. It's a bit faster, a bit thinner, a bit lighter, and a bit shinier than all the tablets I've used before. But, taken altogether--and taken along with the second-gen Apple Pencil--it feels like an entirely new experience. I haven't been this struck by a new device in a while. Over the years, I've owned three or four iPads, a few Android tablets, and a few convertible touchscreen laptops running various OSes. I've always been partial to Samsung because of the S Pen, and I've owned a couple of Galaxy Tabs and the Chromebook Pro: I love taking handwritten notes during meetings, and I like writing my first drafts by hand. But this device, with the Pencil, is leaps and bounds better than any other tablet I've used. Writing and drawing on it feels completely intuitive and fluid. The responsiveness of the interface with the pencil is amazing--it reproduces my handwriting (chicken scratch that it is) perfectly. And more than that, the built-in handwriting recognition in the OS is frankly astounding. Either using the Scribble feature to handwrite form entries or using the Notes app's feature that lets you search your handwritten notes, everything works FAR better than I expected them to. Let me reiterate: my handwriting is atrocious. And yet, this iPad is able to decipher my hieroglyphics with a frequency that actually makes the feature really useful--I was expecting it to be little more than a gimmick, as in the past handwriting recognition apps have been completely useless for me. There've been a few times where I actually giggled out loud when the iPad recognized something I'd written that I could barely read myself. Outside of how perfectly the iPad, iPadOS14, and Pencil have all integrated into my workflow, the design of the device itself is very nice, and the build quality is excellent. The tablet feels oddly light while still feeling very sturdy. And it's thin--even Apple's marketing images really don't do it justice. And obviously the new processor is nice, though I won't pretend to have done enough to even come close to pushing its limits. But the entire experience has been very smooth, even playing around with video editing and trying to find the most graphically-intensive games on the App Store I could. Haven't seen any lag or stuttering at all. All that said, it's not perfect. I do wish Apple was finally putting OLEDs into more of their devices outside of the iPhone. The screen on this really is gorgeous, don't get me wrong. And the blacks aren't awful or anything. But given how great everything else is on this device, having a backlit screen--as advanced and pretty as it is--just feels weird. And I'm kind of ambivalent about the power button TouchID. Don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled the Home button is gone, but I think I'd kinda prefer FaceID. The TouchID on this iPad works great, and it does work very quickly, but I'm spoiled by being used to just tapping the screen on my iPhone and having it unlock itself automatically. Anyway, those minor gripes aside, this is a great little device, it fit itself into my workflow immediately. I think the highest praise I can give it is that it's amazing how quickly it effectively disappeared: within a couple days of using it, I stopped noticing it, because everything about writing and taking notes with the iPad and the Pencil felt second nature, it felt like it had always been there. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.",

Compared to my previous ones, this is blindingly fast, easy to transition and load all my apps from my ipad air 2. I took a bit of time to get used to no home button, but not an issue and the larger screen is a plus. Bottom line, I think this is the best model, unless you absolutelt need the additional features of the ipad pro. ONLY issue I have is with the method of shipment from Amazon. I am a prime member and appreciated the fact that I ordered my two ipad air 4’s on the 23 rd of Oct and got them the 25th. Super! My only issue is them being delivered by USPS, dropped off on my front door, no signature or anything else for $1300 worth of product. Luckily I am in a great neighborhood, but one would expect UPS or FEDEX with a signature. Got them ok though and am very happy with my purchase. And am 99% satisfied with Amazon as well.",

				"text": "UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED! Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable. The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long. Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using \"swap memory\" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board. ***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB. I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models. There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD. ***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly. ------ I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12\" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1. The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco. I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive \"Pro Apps\" running at the same time. I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me. I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball \"not responding\" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac.",

				"text": "Update 01/11/21: Well, I had some issues but I love this thing enough I'm sticking with it. I believe a 3rd party USB hub killed the logic board and touch ID for it. I had to wait about a month to go theough the motions, especially with the time of year. Finally got my replacement back today and I'm really happy. Unreal Engine does not run well currently. It gets crashes and will freeze the computer. Everything else runs super smoothly and I never have issues. Really happy with the laptop. Initial post: Let me start this off by saying I was very skeptical. Lifelong Windows user, I've only had an iPod touch (2011) and very briefly an iPhone 6 (I think). I also have pretty demanding needs as far as day to day laptop use goes. This thing has handled everything I've thrown at it so far. The only drawback is that my current model only has 8GB RAM, but if you're conscious about what you have open it's not an issue; even with more intensive programs like Photoshop or Unreal Engine 4. Neither of which are even optimized for the platform yet, which as stated in the title, is really impressive. Gaming has been equally impressive. To be fair, I haven't thrown a next-gen game at it yet, but I threw games that I thought would be able to max it out. Nope, Civ 6, Borderlands 1, and Oxygen Not Included all ran at Ultra with FPS staying at steady 60+ in each game, even in more intensive portions of each game. I'm not saying it'll be able to play every game at ultra, but it's definitely been able to handle more than I though it would. It almost seems to be outperforming my desktop, which has an i7@3.4, and a 970ti. I think it might if I had the extra GPU core and 16gb ram, which is crazy for a laptop at this price. Overall, it's worth every penny. I could rant about all the small features that make the OS amazing as well, but you can find videos of that online/may already be familiar.",

				"text": "The 1 star is for the poor quality control by Acer. I received the laptop and immediately started to set it up. Upon entering my info I noticed that the D key was not working. I put in a call to Acer tech support and have to send the laptop in to get repaired... the brand new out of the box product. Now I have to repackage everything, wait for a shipping label, drop it off and wait 7-10 business days (fancy wording for two weeks) instead of working on projects that I bought the laptop for. So at this point I am very disappointed in Acer’s quality control. I can’t really review the laptop itself since it was defective from the start. I’m hoping that is the only issue with the machine as most reviews I’ve read about the Nitro 5 are positive. Update: It has been 22 days since I received the brand new laptop from Amazon. Acer repair has had the laptop for 14 days now and I still have not received any info about the status of my case other than it is still being repaired. I am not happy about having to wait 3+ weeks to have a brand new working laptop.",

				"text": "I included potential solutions to the problems I had in the cons section. Pros: -slim size, easy to take on the go -cheap -open slots inside to upgrade components Cons (that I found solutions to): -loud fans, combined with poor audio quality. The built in speaker volume needs to be turned up pretty high to hear over the fan noise. The fan noise also means you should leave your mic on push to talk rather than open during online games, otherwise your poor teammates will have to listen to it constantly. Good news is there is blue tooth, so I suggest connecting external speakers or headphones instead. -hot CPU. Make sure your battery settings are on \"better performance\" rather than \"best performance\", regardless of if it's plugged in or not. Otherwise, the CPU hits 90 C. Better to have less performance or learn to undervolt if you want the laptop to last very long. -wrong GPU used during gaming. If you have really bad performance, it could be that the laptop is using the Intel GPU rather than the GTX 1650. Go into NVIDIA Control Panel, and under \"manage 3D settings\" and \"global settings\", switch preferred graphics processor to \"high-performance NVIDIA processor\" rather than auto. -laptop suddenly restarts within seconds of booting up, when not plugged into power. For me, going into startup apps and turning off \"Delayed Launcher\" fixed this. -not enough space, and plenty of bloatware to make it worse. Definitely invest in at least 1TB of additional storage. 256 GB is only enough space for two or three games, unless you only play games from the 90's. Cons (without solutions I could find): -yellowish smudges at the top of the screen, only visible though when the screen is black -the touch pad is terrible. It's on the left for some reason, so both your hands have to be crammed left to use them during games. Not an issue if you use controllers or a mouse. Also, the mouse is very delayed and floats around. Tried updating drivers but nothing works, it's super laggy most of the time! -keyboard lights only turn on when a key is pressed and automatically turn off after 30 seconds. There is no way to leave them on, which sucks when you're using it in the dark. There are forums complaining about this, and the company refuses to add the feature to leave them on even though many people are requesting the option. -short battery life. This doesn't bother me because I view gaming laptops more like transportable desktops, but keep in mind that this will not last you very long if you want to play on the bus or plane.",

				"text": "After passing off last year's model to my brother (3500U Flex 14), I got this as soon as I saw it posted up on Reddit. I'm thankful I did, since it was sold out within an hour or two and has been since. Let's get the rundown here. - Ryzen 5 4500U 6c6t APU - Radeon Vega 6 graphics - 16 GB of DDR4-3200 MHz dual-channel RAM (CL 22, but that's par for the course for a consumer laptop) - 256 GB SK Hynix NVMe SSD - 1080p IPS touchscreen w/digitizer (pen included!) Build quality is about as good as you can get without moving to all metal. The keyboard deck is rubberized, and the outside is built solidly - no creaking! Hinge is strong, but it opens up almost all the way with one hand (tilts towards the end). The overall design is darn near similar to last year's model, but built a bit more \"premium.\" One exhaust vent at the back, but as you'll see later it really doesn't need 2. I mainly focused on CPU performance, as benchmarks for this flavor of Vega 6 are all over the place already, and given the thermals I saw performance should be what you'll find elsewhere. Long story short - roughly 10% faster than the 3500U's Vega 8 at less power (15 W vs 25 W). The benchmarks speak for themselves, but I was very surprised at what this thing was capable of. I ran these on the included USB-C wall charger (which was a surprising inclusion considering the laptop has a barrel jack for power). The only thing to keep in mind is that this was tested when my room temperature was in the upper 70s to lower 80s, so you could see the temp results as a \"worst case\" scenario. 77c absolute max during Geekbench is crazy for this thing, especially considering how thin it is. Never got too loud, either. Fan isn't whiny at all! Camera is acceptable. Nothing to write home about, but it'll work well enough for video calls. Battery is excellent - while browsing the web and watching videos, I have been consistently draining 10% per hour of use! That 10 hour claim from Lenovo seems pretty spot on. Honestly, I could think of only 3 things that would make this laptop better, but all of them would definitely drive up the price/bump it up a tier: - 120 Hz FreeSync display like the (crippled by 8 GB RAM) IdeaPad Slim 7 - Ryzen 4600U/4800U options for more threads (4700U option is now available in some places) - Metal construction I'll personally be upgrading the storage, but overall it's amazing.",

				"text": "***UPDATE 3 - 12/2/20 - Have had several issues recently and wanted to pass along how I resolved them. Issue #1 was trying to boot up the computer after 12 hours of sleep and being unable to get the computer to turn on at all. Didn't matter if it was plugged in or not. The battery was fully charged. I tried holding the power button. No go, laptop was dead. As a final attempt before sending it in for service, I pulled off the bottom cover of the laptop and disconnected the battery cable for several minutes. I plugged it back in, pressed the power button, and the laptop booted normally. Everything worked fine after that and I haven't had the issue since. Issue #2 was noticing the laptop was no longer charging when connected to the USB-C charger. Even the charging LED wouldn't come on. The fix was to shut down the computer completely, then hold the power button for 20-40 seconds. The charge light came on and the laptop started charging again. **UPDATE 2 - 7/2/20 - Resolved an audio stuttering issue by turning off Dolby Audio processing in the Dolby app.** *UPDATE - 6/10/20 - Dropping a star. Sent original back due to crashing issues when waking from sleep. Wifi also dropped occasionally and had trouble reconnecting after sleep. New unit seems to work fine. Also replaced wireless card with Intel AX200 (need torx T5 bit to remove bottom panel). Much faster and no dropped connections. Still really like the laptop (and Amazon's return policy).* Original Review: Overall usability – Everything about the laptop feels well-built and like it should cost hundreds more. Incredibly fast processor, especially given the 15W TDP. The AMD Ryzen 4000 series processors (7nm Zen 2) have really improved the thermals and efficiency to the same level as Intel (or better). Between the 6 core processor and the PCIe NVMe SSD the laptop flies. Nothing I’ve thrown at it has been able to slow it down or make it stutter. Benchmarks comparable to my HP desktop with i7-7700 (if in best performance mode while plugged in). Applications open instantly in most cases. Comes out of short-term sleep instantly. Nice webcam privacy cover. Fingerprint reader is best I’ve used in terms of accuracy and speed. Fans are quiet under normal loads and a low non-annoying whirring when the GPU/CPU is taxed. Exterior – Very light weight (but not cheap feeling) and nice sturdy build. Feels like it will hold up well. Keyboard back-light adjustable. Plenty of ports. Hinges also feel built to last. Touchscreen – Sensitive and good feel (though I prefer matte to glossy). Works well with included pen. Bloatware – Almost none (uninstalled Skype). Speakers – Above average for price range. Not especially tinny sounding like cheaper laptops. Don’t expect bass though. The included Dolby equalizer software can help improve the sound if you don’t mind experimenting. Side-mounted front-facing speakers are well placed. Screen – Brightness OK for indoor use, but I plan to run it at 90% brightness even on battery because anything less is too dim. Colors are bright. No noticeable back light bleed. Battery life – Above average for price range. Really quite impressive. Could easily last half to three-quarters of the stated 10 hours depending on the conditions (clearly not doing anything processor or graphics intensive for the duration, but web browsing, office work, or video viewing). Wireless/Bluetooth – Some occasional random disconnects and trouble connecting after sleep, likely due to Realtek wireless card. Average speeds on my 5GHz home network. Keyboard/Trackpad – High quality feel. You can tell when you’ve hit a key unlike cheaper laptops. Miss the numpad, but knew it didn’t have one before I ordered. Trackpad not over-sensitive or unresponsive. Good balance, but still prefer a mouse. Graphics/Gaming – Played Two-Point Hospital on Steam at 1080p very high graphics setting. Not very graphics intensive or an FPS, but the game is newer and frame-rate didn’t drop below 30 in game. Game load times are ridiculously fast. Downsides – Mediocre webcam. Soldered RAM (not a big deal w/16 GB, but if it goes bad it is a big problem). Screen may not be bright enough for outdoor use and the glossy coating leads to reflections/glare when viewing from an angle. Wireless card not great. Stories of poor tech support (though, admittedly I’ve never interacted with them). **Don’t forget to create your USB backup drive from the Lenovo website for crashes/re-installs. Or have the Windows 10 ISO handy on a USB drive and download the drivers/apps from the website.",

				"text": "Your browser does not support HTML5 video. For <600, there's only 1 thing I want to complain: the \"Lenovo Representative\" knows nothing about their product. Yes, it has dual channel 16GB RAM @ 3200mhz, it ships with the Lenovo pencil included. Screen is only @ 250 nits, but I wouldn't call it a deal breaker unless you plan to use it outdoors a lot. Plastic machine but nothing feels cheap. The hinge is a little loose to my taste, the touchpad is a little shaky. Other than those, everything fits my needs. Very satisfying first day of use. Update: the audio starts to cutoff randomly from the 2nd day, all drivers and windows updates and BIOS are up to date. I contacted both Amazon and Lenovo tech support, after a remote session, the problem persists. Then I noticed the trackpad is shaky and sticky ( see video). So overall it's a nice product, but quality control can be a problem.",

				"text": "I really liked this little machine and for the price, in my opinion is a steal. It is like 20% faster than my mini PC which sports an Intel Celeron N3450 Quad-core. Per my tests with the 64GB eMMC included, even Windows 10 (v2004) is snappy. I also ran Linux on it with no issues, except that the wireless driver needs to be installed manually(tested on Mx Linux for instance). The sequential reading for the Sandisk eMMC is 316 MB/s and 154 MB/s writing. Once I booted up on the Windows installed, switched from Windows 10 in S Mode to Windows 10 Home for free in the Microsoft App Store and went ahead and activated the Office 365 subscription included for free(1 year). After that, I cleaned up the disk and installed everything from scratch. The drivers can be downloaded from the official Asus homepage. I had zero issues with Windows 10 20H1(v2004) but when tested version 20H2 (v2009), I had issues with the WIFI connection, so left 20H1. Something interesting on this machine is that there's an empty slot for adding our own SSD NVME M.2. I didn't' test it myself as I didn't have a spare SSD, but there are a few videos where someone could put in a 1TB SSD. The BIOS version included was v302, so one of the first things I did was to update to the latest version v306. I wish it had a backlit keyboard and an IPS screen. That would made it perfect for my needs. It's also very well built to be a cheap laptop. Overall, I would buy it again. [UPDATE 2-3-2021] I installed a 512GB SSD and it worked like a charm. The reading/writing speeds are around 1700/1200 MB/s respectively. I just added a screenshot. I did a triple boot (Windows 10, MX Linux and Chrome OS) using Refind and all is working fine. EDIT: I replaced the wireless card with an Intel Wifi6 AX200(Amazon B07SH6GV5S). This new card does not required me to install drivers at all on Windows 10(although intel recommends to install the latest driver version they provide and I did that), Linux (Kernel 5.8) or Chrome OS, which it's a plus for me. Also, tested on Windows 10 20H2 and found zero issues. Really happy with it. I almost forgot to say that this AX200 card also support Monitor Mode.",

				"text": "For what this is supposed to be and for roughly $200, it's fantastic. This isn't a high performance gaming laptop (or really any kind of gaming laptop) and it would be difficult to do precise graphic design work. However, for internet access and word processing and all of your everyday computer uses, it's one of the best you can get. This runs smooth and feels very snappy due to the solid-state drive, and Windows 10 works well. Streaming movies/shows like through Netflix or YouTube works great. If you want to install programs that aren't on the Windows app store, you'll need to disable \"S mode\", but this is easy and quick to do. Just Google \"disable S mode\" and you'll find the steps easy enough. 64 Gbs is more than enough for windows, web surfing, movie streaming, and word processing. However, I wanted to store some photos and other media, so I picked up a 256Gb micro SD card and it seems to work very well. These are relatively inexpensive ($30 or so) and couldn't be easier to install - just insert into the micro SD slot until it clicks. The screen is small for a laptop, but if you've been working with only a smartphone screen for a while like I had been, it seems huge. 😂 ASUS is one of the best quality computer parts manufacturers around, so this also should last a good while. Overall, I definitely recommend this for your more basic computer needs.",

I wanted to buy aftermarket, which is less money. However, if for some reason the aftermarket one damages my phone, will Apple cover it under wrrty? Perhaps not. So I felt compelled to buy Apple brand. Once it is out of wrrty, then aftermarket is for me. Apple could have included a voucher to come to a store or nearby retailer and receive a power adapter. This trillion dollar company should have included the adapter with the phone in some form or fashion. You spend $800 for a phone and then you have to get your own charger. Shame on them.",

				"text": "First off, I want to say that this product does exactly what it's supposed to do and as shown in the photos. It DOES tilt and swivel, contrary to some odd reviews. There are adjustments on the head to hold the camera in either portrait or landscape position, AND it also will tilt facing straight to the ground or directly straight up, contrary to some odd reviews. The BT remote immediately paired with my iPhone X and I was taking tripod selfies with my dog in minutes. Unless we bought different products, people claiming that this head does not tilt or swivel have simply not figured it out yet. It does both. The stick appears sturdy, it stands on it's own easily and the base is plenty wide. Comes with a travel bag, and a GoPro adapter. I just hope that I don't lose the tiny BT fob, may attach it to the stick for safety when traveling. Great purchase!",

The phone holster they sent me was actually different from the first one that broke, and it's much more sturdy! No complaints at all. Good buy, especially since if there's anything wrong, their customer service people will take care of you :) Bought this specifically to record my lifting videos for my coach who is on the other side of the country. Tried to put my phone into the mount for the first time and it snapped right off, had to wait for someone to look free in the gym to record my videos anyway, which was what I was looking to avoid. Was looking forward to using this tripod as it looked a significant upgrade from my last one which also broke, albeit after about 6 months. Very very disappointed.",

				"text": "First, the price point for this at $30 under retail was great, but it would have been nice to purchase the 16GB option. As a first time macOS user, the setup was quite bumpy. Rosetta seems to work great with certain \"unsupported\" applications, in some cases not expecting it to work at all, and would without any hiccups or noticeable slowness. This was the case with Runelite and enabling the GPU plugin made the experience buttery-smooth on an LG 3440x1440 IPS display. However, Firefox (without installing the beta M1 supported version) would consistently freeze and crash and it seemed to be ruled out by plugins, but even without that, certain websites wouldn't work and loading pages after each click took way too long. I experienced another bug with Discord and couldn't see its login setup screen due to what seemed like a file association or visual glitch, and I found out there's no good uninstaller option natively on macOS other than just binning applications to the trash and clearing it from there. So, I had to uninstaller a third-party app to remove all file associations when the application was installed to finally get a clean install and thankfully the Discord install worked well after that. The other downsides for me are general unsupported SOC from various companies/applications, in case I wanted to setup a VM. No eGPU support, and no RAM upgradeability, but that's a given considering the new SOC, just would have been nice to upgrade on our own (and hopefully have made design tweaks to make those upgrades easier for users). Would also have been nice to see a smaller footprint for the enclosure, since it's quite a small SOC based on images I've seen online. You may find yourself feeling like a beta tester, it can get pretty frustrating. So consider yourself warned. Hopefully companies release M1 compatible applications soon. Overall, I'm fairly satisfied and hopeful for more application support in the future. Would highly recommend it for more casual users because it seems like it would be an amazing value under that use case.",

I have 2 Intel Nucs that are the near equivalent of this Mini and while they are great little machines as well, they have been warm at times. Apple has figured a way to be as fast/faster than intel but not use much power in doing so. The downside of this being new technology is that software has to be written for it . In the meantime it uses emulation so older software will work with it, but is only a temporary situation. Firefox started out that way 2 weeks ago but they have already rewritten the browser now so emulation is no longer needed. Risc based processors are nothing new (they made those Dinosaur movies with them) but processors that are fast without using much power or getting hot certainly are. If this is a sign of things to come I feel sorry for Intel. I liked the way the computer performed so much I ordered a second one with larger memory and gifting this one to my fiancé .",

If you are not into the wide angle cameras then this may not be for you but im sure there is some way you could adjust it. Im not sure though on that. Pros: Not too much cost wise compared to most cameras. Wide View and Clear View Looks nice on top of my monitor. It is also able to be put on a stand. Cons: Nothing really that i have any problems with. BUY IT!!!! I included a picture of my ugly mug just to show you what a picture on this camera looks like.

I did a few test pictures and videos and I was impressed with the quality. Sound is decent but you have to sit close to the webcam to get a clear sound, it does do stereo sound. I bought a cheap mic to solve that problem. Only thing missing is a lens cover to protect the glass from dust and impact.

If your state prohibits price gouging in times of emergency (as is happening now with the coronavirus) consider reporting these people. In Illinois the governor extended price gouging protections, check your state. In the past this webcam sold for as little as $40. Now it is selling for well over $200. If that is not price gouging I am not sure what is. Shame on them. This would be a 4-5 star review but for the price issues.",

				"text": "I've now had this monitor for four days. I will update this review periodically as I own it longer. I've had no sleeping/resuming issues at all as others have reported. I am using Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04 and the monitor 100% works flawlessly with both. I give this monitor 5 stars because it accomplishes what it set out to do perfectly. But buyer beware, you need to know what you're getting with this beast. The 1080 vertical resolution doesn't bother me at all. I can now comfortably put three windows side by side to do my work and that alone is worth the price of admission. Gaming wise this thing is fantastic. I have paired it with a Radeon Vega 64 and since it only has half the number of pixels a 4k monitor has, all games run beautifully. Freesync works from 48hz up to 144hz. I am finding most games can handle 3840x1080 rather well, and really recent games handle it perfectly. The view is so immersive, it's just fantastic. This monitor has a DPI of about 80. If you're like me and have been using high DPI monitors for the past few years, this is a pretty, er, striking regression. Yes, you can really see pixels easily on this thing. No, fonts don't look that great (fonts look a little better in Ubuntu than Windows, but regardless nowhere near the beauty a high DPI monitor would provide). To me this is the only real compromise you need to make with this monitor. The gaming and productivity gains I get far outweigh this setback for me. This monitor has no speakers at all. I have it mounted on my monitor arm with no problems. The monitor weighs 33lbs which is the upper limit on my arm. Getting it mounted was quite the chore and nearly led to my wife divorcing me, but we did it. UPDATE 1: I've now been using this monitor for work quite a bit and I have to say I love it. I can fit everything I need comfortably onto the screen. No more switching desktops. It's been a great productivity and \"staying in the zone\" boost. UPDATE 2: I've now had this monitor for 2 months and you will have to claw it out of my cold dead hands. I. Love. This. Thing. My only complaint is how it changes sources, it's a bit tedious. My productivity, focus and happiness while working has increased so much with this monitor, and gaming is fantastic. I use Linux with a tiling window manager. To be honest when I'm in Windows or OSX then this monitor isn't quite as godly. The automatic tiling really helps squeeze out the full worth of this giant beast. I've had zero issues with it. No matter what machine, OS or whatever, it has worked 100% perfectly. I've added an up close photo of text in OSX. Windows looks very similar. This monitor does not render text well due to its low DPI. UPDATE 3: This will be my last update I think, I'm at about 9 months of owning it. The arm I am using is the Loctek D7L. Through some sheer luck I managed to get this monitor at work too. Now my life is pretty much complete. I now use Windows 10 quite a bit at home and at work, and to manage the massive space I have found Divvy works pretty well. Absolutely zero regrets buying this, it's simply stellar.",

				"text": "Pros: Looks very good, tons of work space, equivalent to 2 1080P monitors better for gaming cards than higher resolution monitors that require more pixels be pushed. Great for productivity. Cons: Terrible customer service. Ordered mine directly from Samsung, noticed failed pixel day 1. 1 chat, 2 emails, and 7 phonecalls (1.5 hrs min each) across 5 days they finally tell me they don't do RMA and I have to return for full refund and reorder. Ok, let's go that route. I'm then told I'll receive an email in 3 days for RMA....OK.. when I get my email, I'm told that the backlog of RMA is so great it'll take up to 2wks to get my RMA number and shipping label. What?! In this time, my monitor starts refusing to wake up, will not even show the BIOS. You have to turn it down to display port 1.1 even though my card supports 1.4. device seems to prefer miniDP and they sent non locking cables. After connecting a second computer to HDMI, now monitor won't show anything from ANY input. I moved the second computer to a TV, works fine. Only one computer connected, I'm now trying to resolve the issue, I go into the OSD, auto detect inputs is annoying and terrible, I change freesync settings and monitor turns off and won't come on, reseat power, go into OSD do it again, same issue! This monitor makes me hate Samsung, but when it comes to freesync, this is my best option especially as I wait for VEGA. Their OSD looks great, but it doesn't matter if the monitor runs like crap. Is it worth 1500+tax? NO, HECK NO. Unless you're 100% sure and you're willing to deal with trouble, I say avoid like the plague. If your willing to fight the monitor until it's working and plan to never change the settings, inputs, etc. and you need the screen real estate for super ultra wide gaming with AMD freesync2, pull the trigger. UPDATE: I've been working with Samsung Customer support since Sept 18th trying to get this thing replaced/refunded/repaired. It is now Nov 2nd. Still nothing. They've promised me an RMA label 3 times, first time telling me it takes 15 business days, second time, they were \"sending a truck for pickup\", third time, they didn't know what the other person was thinking and they were sorry, it would be 3-5 business days for RMA label, 4th time got supervisor (Rise ID:126) who admitted samsung RMA dept is having an issue for the past month and is having problems when trying to generate RMA labels and I'm not the only one affected and there is NO ETA of when my RMA label will arrive. I contacted other teams was escalated to ECR who got me a service ticket for repair. Few days later repair ticket cancelled because they don't work on this kind of monitor. Contact them again, give ECR ticket, they try another facility, same issue, few days later they cancel the ticket. Contact them again, they want me to ship the monitor to the other side of the US for repair. NO, NO MORE. its been over 1.5months of trying to get my $1644.36 . I'm talking with ECR right now. I'm being told again, to wait for an RMA label again. I've emailed officeofpresident@sea.samsung.com (was completely ignored) , I've contacted multiple depts. I've used chat, email, and phone. Doesn't appear to go anywhere. Even after I get the RMA label, I'll still have to wait 2wks for a refund. so it'll be over 2 months that samsung has kept my money. UPDATE 2: Ok so in December they sent someone to my house to replace the panel. 3rd party tech from USSI, guy is awesome. Panel replaced, dead pixels will remain. Uh oh. \"It's either the driver board or ribbon cables. Either way, they'll just send a replacement\". Ok, SGTM. Tech takes pictures for documentation proof. Get a reply shortly after. Tech leaves, they are going to replace the monitor. Great! Wait a week, what's going on? Call Samsung to check, Samsung cancelled the replacement. What why? They want pictures as proof of dead pixels. I tell them their technician took pics on their behalf and they have pictures. Ticket reopened. Wait another week, call back, same issue. Cancelled ticket again, same BS reply, I give them hell. They reopen ticket and apologized. They'll contact the tech. OK... Check again a week later. Closed again. I'm furious, I ask to be escalated. They send me to an ECR mgr. I give the ticket number. She starts reading, before finishing she immediately starts apologizing, she's shocked how bad this has gone and for how long. She finishes reading, apologizes again and tells shell handle it. It's the week before Christmas. Sure enough, I get an email and phone call to expect a delivery first Friday of January and they'll swap out the units. It happens! New monitor has none of the glitchiness, no dead pixels, main DP port works fine including 1.2 and up support! Monitor now wakes up appropriately. It was a long journey. It's over. I still love the monitor. It was a PITA getting a working one, but all in all I still would have bought this Monitor. DO NOT BUY FROM SAMSUNG E-COMMERCE! God help you if you have a warranty issue outside return time.",

				"text": "So it was myself first time trying a widescreen, will say it's a different experience. There is no major problem with monitor except that it is an outdated design, not sleek by any standards and does not have height adjustment which could be a big dealbreaker nowadays with work from home. The resolution is not directly supported by older macs so you may need to download a free to try and $14 to buy app. Also you may need to download another cheap app which resizes windows easily. With all that done too i was finding it hard to justify the use, maximized windows on a productivity app would need me to move my head from one side to the other. The highest resolution makes fonts too small to read from a distance and if you keep it near you will have to move your head each time. Some videos and games made for this ratio look great, m sure it would be great for creating video-content as well, but I couldn't say the same for writing and reading apps. Finally may be you'd be better off with a 24' or 27\" normal screen than this unusual size as in effect it doesn't add much. For real meaningful wide screen you may prefer bigger sizes else this size may just feel like a hassle IMHO. Again, the monitor by itself is not too bad but the bigger question is whether you actually need or gain anything by taking this size, or in fact you are losing something actually.",

				"text": "This monitor is nice. It’s like having 2 23” monitors built into one. I work from home as a Licensed Sales Producer for one of America’s premier Property and Casualty insurance company’s. When I took this position my company sent me 2 brand new Dell 23” monitors but we use so many programs at the same time that 2 monitors was not enough. Buying this monitor was perfect. I could fit two full size windows on this monitor. I only use one of the 23” Dell monitors as a vertical screen. Using this monitor I could have essentially 3 windows up and it’s perfect. The Dell is used vertically because one of the programs I use is best used on a vertical monitor because it is long. My job requires that I run typically 10+ programs at the same time and the use of 2 Dell 23” monitors is not adequate. You can work with 2 monitors but it’s not as easy as having an Ultrawide monitor because having 3 23” monitors are better than two. The Dell Optiplex computer they sent me only has the ability to run 2 monitors. One is HDMI and the other is DP. I wished it had a 3rd port for a 3rd monitor but I don’t know where I would put it. The reason this uw monitor works is because one monitor needs to be vertical so you can’t really use that vertical monitor for other programs except for 1. I use the uw as the main monitor and I have my outlook, internet explorer, chrome, excel, word, file explorer, notepad and calculator pulled up at all times. My vertical monitor only runs 1 program and because other programs do not work well on a vertical screen. This uw monitor is perfect for working from home but you would most likely not get this monitor paid for by your company because it’s expensive. I paid for this monitor with my own money because I knew I needed it to do my job smoothly. Another thing I love about this monitor is that it has 2 HDMI ports and 1 DisplayPort so I am able to connect my personal laptop to this monitor and my work computer at the same time. You can switch from two computers with a push of a button so it works out well for me switching between my work computer and my personal laptop. I would not recommend this monitor for gaming but I would recommend it for use by people that are working from home. 1/23/2021 This monitor has held up well. It has a strong base and it relatively light to move from one office to the next. My work computer can only allow you to use 2 monitors so it is limited. I would love to setup 3 monitors but I don’t think it would work on my work computer because it’s a small Dell Optiplex computer that uses I3 processor. With that said, this is the only way you can get around having 3 monitors running at the same time. I could probably use a bigger monitor like a 34” or 38” Ultrawide monitor so I can really have 3 23” monitors running all at once. This will have to work for now as my main monitor. If you need two monitors running horizontally you may need to stack your smaller monitor on top on this monitor to save space. I’ve only had this kind of setup and having two monitors side by side without this monitor will not work well because you would need to push one monitor all the way to the side. 4/7/2021 Still going strong. I’m not sure why some individuals have issues with the stand of this monitor. It has not broken on me or tilts downwards. It is quiet long. If you need to have two monitors running at the same time I would recommend you get this monitor so that you can have one program on your left side and one on your right side so it’s like having a two monitor setup. At the cost of this monitor, it would save you money to buy this rather than buying two standard 23” monitors to save space and money. If I didn’t need to have a vertical monitor that’s exactly what I would do. I may upgrade it to a 34” or a 49” uw so that it would be the same size as two standard 23” monitors. This monitor is a good one and does what it’s intended to do. I have no complaints and I’ve been using this monitor for almost a year now without any problems. I love this thing and I would recommend anyone looking to upgrade to get this for space saving purposes. Thanks and good luck.",

I was using my TV to code, because it was sharp and had good colors, but this spoiled me for generic low end monitors. My eyes are happy with this choice. As for gaming I have not tried it yet.

As a side note that's not very important to this, the stand does feel somewhat flimsy, but I dont think that's a big deal at all. It works just fine as long as you don't have certain tilt and height adjust needs, it will serve you just fine. I also wanted to add that I ordered a second one and while there are supposed to be factory calibrated, I did have to make some adjustments. Mainly just the color temperature which was off by about 4 stops, but now they match perfectly.",

They're a \"mostly\" matte screen so they don't reflect bad either. I'm really pleased overall. I put the two monitors on a larger two arm vesa mount vs the included stands. There are a LOT of options for tweaking the color here, but generally I found the color reproduction to be pretty accurate right out of the box. The only obnoxious thing is that I find that if I connect these via HDMI then they also show up in the computer as an audio device, but it doesn't include any speakers, so that's not cool. Just adds a bit of confusion for people who aren't comfortable managing the audio devices in Windows. I'd not hesitate to buy these again. They look great and are super configurable.

				"text": "Like iphone 11 Pro, Macbook Pro, Airpad Pro; the \"Pro\" denotes a higher end product. Compared to the Airpods (version 2) highest end model (with wireless charging case*); the Airpods Pro is $50 more MSRP. Compared to the non wireless case version it's $90 more *Airpods Pro does have wireless charging case by default. Only one version. Let's go through the differences 1. Physical Appearance: Shorter Stem, but larger bud or head There's a large black airflow grill A mic inside and outside the Airpods Case is same thickness, a lot wider, but shorter. Still uses lighting cable to charge, but it does come with a lighting to USB-C cable 2. In-ear, instead of on-ear If your ear has a small cavum and the original airpods fit perfectly, then the Airpads Pro may be a tight fit/more uncomfortable, but seeing the in-ear design, the ear piece will go into the ear canal and the rest will float in place. Those with normal or larger cavum it'll fit well. Some may not like the ear piece going into their ear canal These ear phones are more for a closed environment than an open one Seeing that it's an in-ear design, you may feel this hollow air effect going on unless you turn on transparency mode (more on this later) or play music with active noise cancelling on Seeing that it's in-ear, it has a tighter grip, better for joggers, those who shake their head around a lot for some reason, or if you run up stairs often. If you have an intense workout regimen and/or do extreme sports and not mindful it still can fall out There's a Ear Tip Fit Test on app. There's several ear tips in box. When you turn on this feature in app it'll calibrate and suggest what ear tips are best listening experience for you If you lose the tips or get them dirty overtime, you can go to the Apple store and get replacement pair for around $4 or get cheaper 3rd party ones when they come out 3. Squeeze instead of tap Instead of tapping on the earbuds, you are pinching or squeezing the stem. 1x to play, pause, and answer calls 2x to skip forward tracks 3x to skip back tracks Press and hold to switch between active noise cancel and transparency mode Still able to say \"Hey Siri\" to do voice commands/adjust volume anytime No physical volume controls on buds 4. Battery life Battery life varies depending on how far away you are from the device and volume you set. Battery depreciation over time. These are just rough estimates Pro in general has 4.5 listening time with active noise cancelling or transparency on. Airpods version 2 has 5 hours. Note Airpod version 2 does not have active noise cancelling or transparency mode. You can get 5 hours with noise cancelling and transparency off, but most likely you're not going to unless you're really desperate for battery Pro has 3.5 talk time. Airpods have 3 hours Case both old 24 hours battery life Pro: 5 mins in case = 1 hour talk or listen time. Airpods 15min in case = 3 hours listen, 2 hours talk 5. Water/sweat resistant Now you can go to the gym and do cardio with them on. As mentioned before, tighter grip seeing that it's in-ear May survive light rain. Do not recommended going in the shower or dunk in the pool with it though 6. Active noise cancellation, Transparency mode Airpods pro has 3 modes: Active noise cancellation, off and Transparency mode Active nose cancellation tries to block out outside noise while listening to music. I'd say it drowns out may 70%. If you focus to outside or aren't focused to music; you still may be able to pick out what's going on, but in general it does it's job. Off is just like the standard in-ear headphones, but with the hollow air sound when no music is playing Transparency mode. The black airflow grills let in outside sound so you're able to hear both outside sound and music same time. Think of it as open ear headsets. Unlike some in-ear headsets the black airflow grills prevent you from hearing yourself in your head when you talk 7. Sound Quality Better than the previous version seeing the active noise cancelling and in-ear with more focused sound direcly into your ear canal. It's not $250 audiophile quality sound. Better quality sound in lows and mids compared to non-pro version. If you ever tried the Power Beats Pro, it sound very similar to those You can hear callers better in a noisy environment and less likely raise your voice --Conclusion: Other than that, all other features are the same. Meant to be used on Apple devices. Very good ease of use for Apple users, and is in-style these days (shows social status). Sound quality is better that the non-PRO version, and you do get noise cancellation. There are other headphones that do it better sound in this price range, but may not be as convenient with pairing to Apple devices.",

				"text": "I pre-ordered these headphones before reading any reviews because I have been so desperate to find good headphones to run with. In my nearly 30 years of existence, I’ve never been satisfied with a pair of headphones. I probably have the weirdest shapes ears ever because nothing fits them. Either they slide out or hurt, or both. Day 1- FINALLY THEY’RE HERE!!! 😍 I charged them while finishing my work day up (I think they came pretty much charged because they were at 100% within 5-10 minutes) then eagerly headed to the park for a test run. The temp has reached the 90’s here in Mississippi so it was inevitable that they would be receiving a sweat test! After 3 miles (41 minutes, let me mention I’m a beginner runner) I realized I never had to adjust them or push them back into my ear, not ONCE! I’m thinking this is too good to be true! I had forgotten I even had them on, other than the fact that I had a clean crisp bass playing in my ears. I also own a pair of Studio beats, and honestly these ear buds sounds almost as good... which is pretty awesome to not have to wear something so bulky but still have the noise cancellation and sound quality. Overall, it’s only been one day but my first impression is absolutely amazed. Side note, these were shipped in a box big enough to fit a baby heifer and it looked like it had been thrown off a mountain. I could almost remove the tiny product box through an opening of the baby heifer shipping box. Not sure if Amazon or UPS is to blame for that, but it definitely wasn’t the headphones fault.",

				"text": "I want to preface this before I say anything about these headphones: I primarily use headphones for music and podcasts while I am cycling, running, or sitting at my desk at work. I use Spotify for music, and I am not an audiophile. I am not comparing these to a pair of Sennheisers with a lossless audio format as my source. I also am using an iPhone 7+ and iPad Air 2 for my devices in this review. I have been waiting on a getting a pair of truly wireless headphones because none seemed to be worth it to me. The battery life is usually dismal for obvious reasons, and most had complaints of cutouts between the earbuds. Some friends of mine have Air Pods and they all said they didn’t have cutout issues and battery life was pretty good. But, I just didn’t like the design of the Air Pods and they sounded “hollow” to me. But I get their appeal. I am so glad I waited for the Powerbeats Pro (PBP)! I was using the Jaybird X3 before I got these, and I think the sound is on par with them. One of my main annoyances with the X3’s was that the cord would tug once sweat built up on my neck while exercising, and I couldn’t use the cable shortener they provide because of the way my helmet is. I went for a bike ride yesterday with the PBP’s, and they were fantastic! It was a little windy, so I did get a little wind noise. I am hoping Comply makes some tips for these because I think that would make the noise isolation much better. My ride was around 2 hours and I still had 80% left on the PBP battery. Cons: 1. The case: it’s actually smaller than I thought, but would still be uncomfortable in a pocket. I think the 9 hour battery life on the actual headphones make this acceptable, but this may be deal breaker for some. 2. Ear fatigue: I didn’t have any fatigue during my ride, but my ears were definitely a little sensitive where the hook was resting after I took the headphones off. I’m hoping this gets better as I wear them. 3. Like the Air Pods, the PBP’s can only be connected to one device at a time. They will pair to all Apple devices on your iCloud account, but if you want to switch between devices, you have to go into your Bluetooth settings and select them. On Android you will need to pair each device separately. 4. I usually listen to a podcast when I go to sleep. These are not comfortable to lay on if you are side sleeper like I am. Also, the button the headphones will get pushed by the pillow. The button doesn’t require much force, which is great because your not shoving the headphones into your ear. Not a huge deal, but just thought I would mention it. Pros: 1. Great sound for Truly wireless, I think. 2. Great fit for exercise. 3. Pretty good sound isolation, but like I said, I am hoping Comply makes some tips for these. 4. Actual headphones are smaller than I thought they would be, and they don’t look weird on you when you are just walking down the street. Bottom line, if you use an iOS device and use headphones while exercising, I can’t recommend these enough! In my opinion, the $250 price tag is worth it given where other truly wireless headphones are priced.",

				"text": "I have owned the Bose QC 35 series I (the originals) for four years now, and just recently replaced the ear pads since they finally deteriorated. I figured after four years there has to be some serious improvements in noise cancelling technology, and since the WH-1000XM3 model got so many good reviews I figured these would be awesome. So I pre-ordered them. I pulled them out of the box and followed the very quick connect process of downloading the app and using it to pair to my phone. It downloaded a firmware update automatically while I fiddled around with some settings briefly and listened to some music. Super easy, awesome. The sound is very impressive. Punchy kick drum (I listen mostly to rock/metal) and nice bright sound. I quickly settled on a slightly customized version of the included Bright preset. But things quickly went downhill from there. After using the headphones for a bit, the touch controls became frankly annoying and easily susceptible to mistakes (I triggered track skips multiple times just by removing and putting the headphones back on). The volume adjustment is especially tedious...if you want to raise or lower the volume significantly you have to swipe it up or down a large number of times because the volume adjustment is done in small increments. With the Bose QC 35 and its dedicated buttons, you just quickly push the buttons. Simple. I spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out how to pair the headphones with my laptop, reading the guide in the app and doing some web searching, thinking it must be provided by one of the two dedicated buttons like on the Bose QE 35s. Nope. It must be done with the app. In fact, everything has to be done with the app except whatever you have the custom button configured to do, and the power. On the Bose I just have to slide the power button, and it goes into pairing mode. Simple. The above are honestly smaller issues that you could probably put up with since the sound these produce is so good. However, the deal breaker for me was when I connected them with the included wire to the controller on my Roku Ultra to enjoy some TV time after a long day. I always watch movies and TV with headphones. To my horror they produced a clearly audible hissing sound that is incredibly distracting. I turned them off and on again, disconnected and reconnected the cable. No change, still the hissing sound. My Bose don't produce this sound. Ugh. After listening to them for a couple hours I had a slight headache and felt fatigued, almost nauseous. I know some people are affected differently by the noise cancelling technology, but I don't get this from my Bose, even after listening to them all day. Additionally, speaking of noise cancelling, I compared my Bose QC 35s to these, and I couldn't tell the difference between the noise cancelling. They sound the same to me. :shrug: I'm sure you could tell the difference with laboratory equipment though. All-in-all the sound these produce is really good, and the noise cancelling is great (although I can't tell the difference from my Bose QC 35 Series I). But they have 1) lots of annoyances in the touch controls instead of dedicated buttons, 2) the fact that the app is required to do everything (including pairing) except turning them off and activating the custom button, 3) the hissing on the wired connection to my Roku Ultra, and 4) the fatiguing after listening to them. I'll be returning them.",

				"text": "Download Sony Headphone Connect App, open box, turn on headphones (bottom of left headphone on/off switch), using Sony Connect App, connect and paired new headphones. - My headphones were 100% charged out of box. - Many features in Sony Connect App, matter of your preference and use. I do think the app is solid and useful for my use of these headphones. - My headphones firmware updated automatically -be patient, process took several minutes. Initial impression; very comfortable, really good noise canceling and sound quality. - Voice clarity on both ends is outstanding. - Easily connected two iPhones, my experience switching between them was seamless. - Used ear profile in-app feature to analyze my ear shape for 360 Reality Audio setup. - Able to connect to MacBook Pro (2020 version) directly via Bluetooth with no issues. UPDATE: >30 hours of iPhone X, 8, and Bluetooth MacBook Pro connection. - The phone call quality is awesome (you can hear - No video lag/latency on FT and Zoom calls. - I have found the connection at times can be a bit cumbersome when having two devices connected and receiving calls, it might be a setting or how I am picking up the call --directly from the phone or double-tapping on the headset. - Great noise suppression to the wind, outside city/road-noise, etc... No reported issues with other people on calls with me. Always told call quality was very crisp and clear... my experience, much better than Apple Airpod Pro for suppression of noise for callers on the other end. - I have also now used these headphones for Bluetooth connection to Nvidia Shield connected to my TV for over 16 hrs. Easy direct connection directly from Nvidia Bluetooth Settings. TV and Movie surround sound is great, you can hear the slightest sounds. Bose 700 vs. Sony WH-1000XM4 - Seamless connection - prefer SONY - Comfort - prefer Sony - Headphone sound controls - prefer Bose. Sony touch control works ok but the Bose increase/decrease volume seems to work better on Sony - Noise-canceling for me, both performed in a similar way - Call quality, for me, both performed in a similar way I Will continue to test and use Bose but the feel of the headset on my head is not as comfortable as Sony. UPDATE: Running 7.3 Update - Not sure if related but the initial bluetooth connection and subsequent connections are problematic; - I have had to reconnect several times via the app and my phone needs to be very close to the headset; - Once I am connected it has worked but I have had to repeat the process a few times now; - Additionally, after significant use, the touch controls are a nice feature but not ideal under some circumstances. For example, if you have a hoodie on, jacket with hood, etc... touch control is sensitive and fabric, cord, ect... will effect the touch controls. - I am running iphone X with latest iOS, should be receiving iphone 12 Pro this eve and will update with any new comments. UPDATE April 2020: been using these headphones for several months now. Running and walking are great however, the Touch Sensor Control is not ideal for me, especially when using while exercising. I find the controls/sensor unforgiving and one misstep can restart a song and or podcast, other than they continue to work very well. Used these headphones for a extended 12+ hrs flight and another 9 hour flight.. great noise canceling and sound. Hooked up directly to Qatar Qsuite entertainment system with provided cable, sound quality was excellent.",

I am primarily using these for WFH (music/calls) and the mic on the 700's is said to be amazing. As I researched I googled around and found that Bose has been having weeks of software issues and didn't want to get into that. I almost pre-ordered the M4's but decided to sleep on it because it didn't make a difference being in a queue. Finally one day, I found a YouTube video on the M4 and all my concerns were already addressed. I was sold. Yesterday (Aug 18th) these arrived at my door and I was on calls ALL DAY. They were perfect.

				"text": "Works great with A7. For the price, you can't beat it. Before you whine about the performance, put the current firmware on both your camera and lens (as of this writing, that would be 3.20 and .2 respectively), and then go into the settings and enable Phase Detect. AF is fast up to F4, after that the camera needs more time to hunt. For someone like me coming from a Canon 40 2.8 STM w/Commlite adapter, this is not a big deal, and is still way faster than any adapted lens. Corners are soft and hazy wide-open. In any case, 99.9% of the time your audience is going to marvel at how blurred the background is, while the other .1% is measuring the bokeh balls with a caliper for uniformity. Who cares? It's a portrait lens, for crying out loud. Stop-down if it bothers you. Beyond F5.6, this lens is sharp as nails and produces landscape scenes with stunning detail. This lens is light-weight. I can see myself traveling with just this lens. It's a 50mm lens, it produces beautiful images on the A7, and most importantly, it doesn't cost half the price of the A7. Believe me, nobody is going to look at your image shot with this lens and say , \"Aha! You didn't shoot this with the $900 Zeiss!\".",

				"text": "For the price you really don't have another native lens option. As others have stated the auto-focus on this lens is probably the worst of any native FE mount lens. First it uses a DC motor, so lots of pulsing to focus. Also the motor is fairly audible so not the best choice in video. For the price the image quality is excellent. Bokeh is smooth and non distracting. The lens design is some what of a 'classic' so it is more susceptible to flare than many modern lenses. I have actually found using this in continuous autofocus increases the usability of the focus greatly. For some reason single focus loves to hunt and give up in low contrast situations when the continuous does a much better job. Video auto focus is a lot better than you would expect, but I would say it's critical that you have an external mic or you might pick up clicks from the DC motor. I recently received my A7III with Sony's newest focusing technology and the same issues remain, and the lens is at the latest firmware (3).",

The Minolta focused faster indoors. That is ridiculous. This lens is an embarrassment for Sony. I wish they made something under $500 before stepping up to the Ziess. The 85mm 1.8 is a masterpiece and sells for $600, so Sony just needs to put that focusing tech into a 50. Meanwhile, if you are looking for a cheap prime, I would recommend the samyang 35mm 2.8. It is super small and only 85 grams, it focuses faster than this lens and is often on sale for about the same price. If you keep the subject centered and can crop, you won't get the same DOF, but with more responsive AF you will have more keepers when trying to keep up with moving subjects or lower light. Until Sony makes a better version of this lens under $500, I will stick with a pair of 35mm and 85mm FE lenses that can be acquired new, on sale, for about $820. If you need this focal length, the 55mm 1.8 is the only AF option. Otherwise, pick up an older fast manual focus nifty 50 and a cheap adapter, and you will probably have better results than this clunker of a 50mm.",

				"text": "20191230 2333: For over $200, and for only a 50mm prime, well, it just isn't amazing. The picture quality is OK, but I get sharper pictures from my old manual primes. Even compared to my Minolta 50mm AF, it just isn't as sharp. Physically, it looks and feels much like the kit lens that comes with the a7x cameras. Very light, very plastic. The autofocus is fast, and the eye autofocus works reasonably well on my a7ii. The f-stop is 1.8, but wide open it doesn't seem to be very sharp. I will, eventually, get around to doing a proper test of the lens, and I will add that to this review. Unlike the old Minolta lens, which does give fantastic shots wide open, this lens is better around f/4 and higher. It seems, like with most Sony lenses, if you want a good prime, you'll need to drop a grand or more. If clarity really matters, look at the 85mm G Master (but sit down before you look at the price).",

				"text": "I use the original G502 before hero came out for years then moved to the M65 which I loved. Now I have a NEW wireless set up using the G915 keyboard, I’ve been searching for the best WIRELESS gaming mouse for myself. I BOUGHT and RETURNED: G703, G902, G PRO, G502 LS, Dark Core, Razer mamba & viper. I was going to stick with the viper even thro it was too small for my larger right hand. Until I seen the Basilisk Ultimate release. Returned the Viper tried out the Basilisk and now my new wireless set up is completed. This is a true G502 killer, if you bought the G502LS well return it and buy this. The thumb paddle is better to press than the G502 and the Basilisk PTFE feet glides so smooth/feels better in my hand and RBS is amazing compeer to all wireless mouse and to top that off it weighs less with no double click issues and a RBG charging dock I really like the IDEA of the thumb “Clutch/Paddle” button but I do wish the piece was longer. I would of taking less battery power option if they could have got this down to 99g or less. Customizable Scroll Wheel Resistance is a fantastic idea to compete with Logitech free wheel. Every company should now be using PTFE feet glides. Good job Razer. Razer Synapse 3 works well for me no issues with software. Macros/Keybinds Wifi 2.4 Hyperspeed Wireless is amazing NO LAG what’s so ever I mostly use the NVIDIA SHEILD TV and play OVERWATCH or when I work from home/laptop. Since I use the Nvidia Shield to play Overwatch I need to map the mouse side buttons to a number/letter to make it work in game on the Shield. This works well and macros too. I have to save all settings to the ON BOARD MEMORY. I wish I had more than 5 profiles but I am happy that I have 5 and not just 1-3 I am very DISSAPOINTED that no RBG lighting settings SAVE to OnBoard memory. Even a few simple options to be saved would have been grateful. Oh-well… Basilisk Pros Hyperspeed Wireless – ZERO LAG and 100% amazing The RGB charging DOCK is simply PERFECT, what a great feature. PTFE glides mouse feet are the best. All mice should come with this. Fits my right larger hand type very well. Love the thumb rest Clutch/Paddle (sniper) thumb button piece feels GREAT to press Side buttons are larger than viper buttons. Perfect length on the left/right mouse clicks Clicking all buttons feel GREAT Customizable Scroll Wheel Resistance (Logitech free wheel still better) Left/Right wheel buttons are great to have. (I use them for some macros) Works well on the Razer Sphex V2 & SteelSeries QcK mouse pads Grips very well, feels good in hand Sensor seem to be great Small size dongle Glides very well Still can use wired if needed Battery life is amazing Works great on the NVIDIA SHIELD TV device RBG lighting is absolutely beautiful ! On board memory 5 profiles Basilisk Cons ! On board memory does NOT save RBG lighting settings =( WTF WHY? The clutch button piece could be LONGER or longer option pieces (still better than G502) Not UBS-C (Doesn’t really matter as there is a charging dock) No Bluetooth big scroll wheel Some Finger prints show Weight (Could be lighter - #1 thing to improve on) PRICE (But at $170 with dock it’s cheaper than getting a G502LS with charging mat) Its OCT of 2020 and mouse is working great love it. I have dropped mouse on floor few times with no issues still working fantastic. The software could be designed better but it is what it is.",

				"text": "Nothing is ever 5 stars - hence 4 star review. I haven't seen anything that compared this to the G502 on reddit (maybe I'm just not looking hard enough I suppose), so I just wanted to post something here, as a totally unofficial reviewer but a consumer. The way I play games, my wrist generally doesn't move or moves very little, if that gives you an idea of how I hold mice. The feel of the Basilisk is super similar to the G502, nearly the exact same shape which is a good thing because the G502 fit my larger hand very comfortably. I think the biggest other concern I had was the \"clickyness\" of the left and right mouse buttons. I had used a Deathadder Elite before and honestly, I just really hated it because of how squishy the left and right buttons felt. This mouse uses a different switch, and it feels a lot \"clickier\", nearly the same as the G502. Truthfully, the G502 is clickier and I think also has a cleaner click noise (seems like a shorter, sharper click noise than the Basilisk), but the Basilisk click is close enough to the G502 click that it hasn't bothered me at all. In terms of actuation force, I think the G502 required maybe a little bit more, but the force is fine on the Basilisk. The biggest thing to me was that it didn't feel smooshy at all, and it doesn't! Middle (mouse wheel) click is horrendous. Just do not use. Of course, the RGB is better than anything out there, and the included charging stand works well (and includes settings for lights changing based on various charging states). I've owned the G502 for nearly 2 years and I was curious to see how wireless mice had progressed since the last one I owned (another Logitech mouse, I think the 702 or something) back in 2015. So far, playing League of Legends (I use controller for FPS) I haven't noticed any problems, and it does feel quite liberating to not have the cable holding it back :-) Overall, I'm satisfied with the (expensive) mouse. I guess if there was one thing I could change on it, it would be to have the ability to charge it on that cool mousepad Razer makes that charges another one of their wireless mice (forget the name of it). Other than that, I think it's great and I think I will allow this to replace my G502.",

				"text": "I waited too long to switch back to the FPS king. This chip is amazing. I missed you Intel. The PC world is weird. Always chasing $50 savings. Too many games have CPU bottlenecks. I debated hard between just buying a 3700x to replace my 2700x versus the hard MB/CPU upgrade to Intel. But AMD had left me frustrated. My 2700x was never maxed out and I couldn’t tell what was bottleknecking me. The 3700x didn’t promise much higher clock speeds so I wasn’t sure if an upgrade would help. I play Rust on 1440p and my GPU and CPU would sit at 60% utilization or less with frames only around 70fps. First test with the 10700k stock and I’m at 135fps, max graphic settings. My GPU is now pumping out 99% utilization and the game feels amazing. This chip runs cool on stock. Idk where all the bad thermal predictions came from, but it didn’t happen. Haven’t even OC’d it yet and honestly I may not need to until I upgrade off of my 2080super. But that’s not happening any time soon. I’m hitting 144fps on 1440p max settings now in every FPS game and that was the goal. Thank you Intel, you nailed this one. The 9th gen had some cost/heat issues and that made me give AMD a try and I’m glad to be back! For anyone choosing a card. The 10700k is the sweet spot for gaming and streaming. If you only game, I think the 10600k is a cheaper but same performance. I don’t see any need for the 10900k.",

Should you upgrade 9th gen, or even 8th gen to 10th gen? Honestly, probably not. But if you're say, a few of more generations behind now, it's a worthy upgrade. Yes it's an upgraded 9900k, but that's still really good for ~$400!

				"text": "Pros - This is a great CPU with Single-core performance that surpasses any intel competitor and multi-core performance that smashes most of the competition. It's incredibly energy efficient for the performance gains and has great thermals. *Upgrading from a I5-2500K, everything I can think of doing is smoother and more responsive. Your milage may vary. Neutral - Does not come with an in box cooler for those of you wondering. Suprised there wasn't a wraith prism pairing with this 800x generation considering the thermal performance but you'd be better off using am aftermarket cooler regardless. *Paired mine with a Cooler master ML240RGB and my max load temp was 74°C before stabilizing at 64°C in a case with 'OK' ventilation under max load (CPU-Z stress test). *Only my memory and Infinity fabric were OC'd. Cons - Now we come to the two elephants in the room. 1. You gotta be lucky to even get the chance to buy one. Whilst this didn't sell out as fast as the 900x and 950x. It did sell out faster than the 600x and I have not seen it back in stock yet. 11/11/20 2. This processor is a little overpriced compared to it's siblings that flank it. ● 5600x has 6C/12T, 35Mb cache and is priced at $299. ● 5800x has 8C/16T, 36Mb cache and is priced at $447? *2 more cores, 4 more threads and 1 Mb more cache for $150 price increase? Ok. ●5900X 12C/24T, 64Mb cache and is priced at $547. **4 more cores, 8 more threads and double the cache for $100 more???? TLDR Great CPU, $50 over priced. If you can afford it (or even purchase it in the first place) Buy a 5900x as it's a better value. If not, save a $150 and buy a 5600x. Identical performance in games and not too far off in production work loads.",

				"text": "At the time of writing this CPU has only been 'available' for about 2 weeks and I'll admit I got very lucky in getting one on launch day. Most will probably find this hard to find until demand/supply stabilize but if you're fortunate like me here are some things I have found so far: This CPU is a top performer at it's tier. There's a plethora of data at this point in benchmarks about the Ryzen 5000 series and they seem to outscore most of the Intel competitors easily, as well as against the previous Ryzen 3000 series line. Personally I don't think this alone is a great reason to buy this product currently but I will expand later on value, my previous setup was an 8700K and I felt this 'worth' the upgrade for me personally. I use it on a near exclusive gaming PC, with some occasional video rendering and I can see improvement across the board. I play most games at 1440p however, and vs my old 8700k I can tell you the performance gain on average is probably less than 5%. In rendering and workstation benchmarks its much more, to be expected with core count increase. This CPU in my system tends to run HOT. At least hotter than I expected @ 105W TDP. I'm on a MSI Tomahawk x570 with an Arctic Liquid Cooler 2 280mm AIO, and with stock settings stress testing I'm reaching 75 C quickly, sometimes maxing at 85 C depending on the task. I've checked my mounting and I don't think there is an issue. My system is using a Phanteks P500A with high airflow as well. I've found examples of others reporting this as well online, and it seems exclusive to the 5800x currently. I've done some extended stress testing and it doesn't seem to thermal throttle so I'm not too worried, while gaming it peaks around 68 C. Overall I've had zero stability problems or crashes so far which is better than expected as AMD has been known in recent years as a problematic launch platform with driver/BIOS issues. Hopefully this stays the same! In terms of value this is probably not worth it to most who are interested. The 5600x is (for now) the value/performance king of the new series and the 5900x has notable advantages for only $100 more. I think there is still fantastic value in the R5 3600 as well, especially since it can be occasionally had for around $175. If the price of the 5800x drops to $400 or less in the future it will be become a much more compelling purchase. Consider that this is also the end of the line (supposedly) for the AM4 platform. I think you can make a reasonable argument for 10th Gen Intel due to a potential next gen upgrade capability but who knows if it will be worth the wait. TL;DR: Top performer, value questionable, warm running Ryzen CPU. I'm an enthusiast who wanted to buy into this series before we even knew it was capable, most will find this unnecessary for mid-high tier 1440/4k gaming. *EDIT* - For those who are interested, I've done more temperature and benchmark and found that enabling ECO Mode in AMD Ryzen Master software is a fantastic way to mitigate high temps. It seems to drop the total power draw from 145w (PBO/OC mode enabled) to about 88w, maintains the same Single-Core score in Cinebench and has virtually no effect on gaming. Heavy multi-core workloads suffer to the tune of about 10% i.e. Cinebench, Handbrake encoding, etc. This is now my default setting, I've noticed CPU intense games dip a little, but still higher performing than my old 8700K and temps on average are 20% less. This is now my default setting as odd as that sounds, maintains my fan/pump speeds much lower and therefore quieter and for 90% of the 1440p gaming I see no performance effect. Maybe this will be improved with further BIOS updates but for now this seems to be the safest option.",

I'm on calls throughout the day, connected to bluetooth, and have no problems with it lasting all day. - Added 32 Gig SD card filled with MP3s (could not get 128GB card, seems like 32 is the max) THE BAD: - Text messages have the wrong time! I tried playing with the clock settings, but this is not the issue. Does not matter if you set the time or put it in \"auto\" the text messages that come in have the wrong time. You'll see other reviews mention this. - It has frozen me a few times. When I say frozen, I mean completely frozen where holding the power button doesn't even power off the device. I am not getting this as often as other people on the reviews, but it does happen. - I noticed that the bluetooth range kind-of sucks. If I am listening to music and put my phone farther than arm's length, sometimes the music breaks up. THE UGLY: - When I am on speaker people on the other side say I am cutting off. This does not happen when I am off speaker or using my bluetooth headset. Only happens on the speakerphone and it's really disappointing. When I am on a conference call, I have it on speaker until it's time for me to talk. CONCLUSION: I'll keep using this phone until I find something better. This has everything I want, just wish it was more polished.",

Calling is great. Messaging is the opposite of great. Whenever someone texts me, no matter from what timezone, it gets \"received\" three hours early. So, since all messages are sorted by sent and received timestamps, my friends messages are all above my messages. So I'll have ALL of my messages at the bottom and I have to scroll past them all to see their messages. I'm not sure if my phone is just flawed, but this is a huge problem that I'm not sure how they overlooked. It might not seem like a big deal, but you have to keep track of the order of messages sent yourself so that you can understand the messages. Also, I have a multi-media message notification that will not leave the notifications on the front page. I have reset to factory settings and checked for software updates, but the messaging isn't fixed. If anyone can help, I'd appreciate it greatly. I have T-Mobile in the US btw.",

I buy Apple gear all the time, and the boxes are always wrapped in plastic -- this was not. Upon opening the box I noticed the plastic sleeve the keyboard was in was upside down. There's a small tab that makes it easy to pull the keyboard out of the box. This was facing down, under the keyboard, instead of up. And, the shipping box was way oversized for the product and had only two small pieces of packing paper, so the box was pretty well smashed.

I also wasn't a fan of the Apple Smart Keyboard (the cover with the keyboard cooked in). It was just too cramped plus I already had a smart cover so no reason to have two covers. I found out that I could use this keyboard when talking to an Apple Store employee while looking at iMacs. We paired a keyboard up to an iPad and I was sold (although I bought it on Amazon because it is $10 cheaper compared to buying it from Apple). Since it is an Apple keyboard, the battery life shows up in the battery widget along with the iPad battery life and Apple Pencil battery life. Screen brightness and volume controls on the top work with the iPad. I was also able to pair this up with my iPhone 8 but not sure I would ever do that in the future. If there would be one suggestion for iPad users who want to use this keyboard, I would buy a case for it if you are going to travel around with it, like me going to campus and putting it in my backpack. I purchased a Hermit Shell case and it fits perfectly.",

				"text": "I have the full sized Apple Keyboard with the numeric keypad, the original Wireless Apple Keyboard and now the Magic Keyboard. I'll go through each and list what makes the Magic Keyboard upgrade worthy. Full Sized Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad Obviously, these are great for those who need the extra keys. However, the problem for me is the length of the keyboard. Due to its length, it pushes the mouse or the trackpad too far off to the side for my comfort. I have since purchased an ergonomic chair ( Steelcase Leap Fabric Chair, Black ) with highly adjustable arms, but prior to owning this chair, having the mouse so far out to the side hurt my shoulders. The other issue is the big movement required to reach the mouse. And of course, the wires. I hate wires. So I purchased the bluetooth keyboard from Apple. Apple Wireless Keyboard These were great. It had amazing battery life and the keyboard felt good. Due to the shorter length, the mouse or trackpad can be placed right next to the keyboard and you don't need an exaggerated movement to reach it. One thing that has always bothered me about the wireless keyboard was the angle of the keyboard due to the battery compartment. I kept wishing that it could sit flatter on the desk. Magic Keyboard It's flatter! My wrist is thankful for it. This alone convinced me to purchase it. The rechargeable battery is also a great improvement from the previous generation. Some people worry that the built in battery will need to be replaced, but I am fairly certain that I will want to replace my keyboard before the battery dies. And if it does die, I can always plug in the lightning cable and use it as a wired keyboard. Battery life is great. I initially purchased the Magic Keyboard back in 10/29/2015. It came with a 99% charge. It's now 11/11/2015 and still has 82% remaining. I use my computer A LOT because I work from home and write software for a living. The much talked about key travel is also worth mentioning. I type around 120 words per minute. I was able to reach that speed on Typeracer (it's an online typing game where you compete with others -- type faster, and your race car moves fasters towards the finish line) immediately, but it just didn't feel right. The only thing I have to say is to give it a chance. Your brain with adapt to it. It feels like my fingers are using less force and doing less work. I don't notice it much anymore because I'm so used to it (that is not until I use another keyboard). The other thing that really bothered me was the arrow keys. The left and right keys are full sized but the up and down keys are not. This kept throwing off my muscle memory. My fingers kept missing the up and down keys as I instinctively reached for them. Also, due to the lower profile of the keys, it was harder to get the tactile feedback to discern between the keys. The old Wireless Keyboard had a deeper groove separating the up and down keys so it was easier to sense the keys. I eventually got used to this, too, though it took a bit longer. Looking at the keyboard I can see why Apple made this design choice. Finally, the keyboard looks better and sleeker than the previous generation. Attached are some photos for comparison. Do I love it (5 stars)? Well, no, because I thought the original price was expensive enough but this one is even more expensive at $100 ($30 jump). But I really do like it, hence the 4 stars. I would not have trouble recommending it to someone who already has the original Wireless Keyboard. Update 12/6/2015: Someone asked if it's loud compared to the old wireless keyboard. I just tested it, and although the sound different, the previous generation is definitely louder. They sound different (older one has more bass). I'm not sure how much these will help, but below are the recordings for comparison. Previous Apple Wireless Keyboard [...] New Magic Keyboard [...] Also, I haven't had to recharge my battery yet. I'm at 47%. Update 4/29/2016: Still loving it. The rechargeable battery is great. Even though the previous model has great battery life, I still find it annoying whenever I have to replace the batteries and I have none readily available. I ran into this exact situation last week (I still have the previous gen). The rechargeable battery is just one less thing to worry about. Update 5/14/2016: It's still going strong. The battery life is phenomenal. The letter S is barely visible because it has faded due to it being used so much. It's followed (in degree of fading) by A, C and E. This problem of letters fading has also been a problem with the previous Apple Keyboards. Since having used this keyboard for over a year, I have gotten very used to the short travel distance. When I type other keyboards, I have difficulty pressing the keys all the way because I'm so used to the shorter travel distance. If it were to break, I'd buy another one to replace it because I prefer it that much more.",

				"text": "I agree with many reviewers about this camera's strengths. They are listed, below. I travel a lot and and shoot a lot and though I have been happy with the portability/flexibility of small sensor cameras with large zoom ranges, every one of them eventually let dust onto the sensor. Bad! Yes, I have even taken these cameras apart to clean the sensor (2x!) That's a lot of time and a lot of very tiny screws! So, even though this camera is bigger and heavier than long zoom pocket cameras, the weather-proofing and dust-proofing was the most important feature, to me, combined with the zoom. A few weeks with it, now, and I couldn't be happier. Rain and dust have not hampered thousands of picture taking moments. Good! But the amazing zoom and speed of operation on this camera is simply astonishing! With plenty of light, this camera takes amazing pictures in manual or auto, from 25mm to 600mm. >The ability to shoot shutter priority, aperture priority, full manual, or full auto >Fast, quiet autofocus and zoom >Tilt and swivel touch-screen monitor >Very sharp framing and focusing in any light with the crisp, bright EVF >Very good 4k video >A decent built-in, variable-output flash and a hotshoe >The ability to shoot RAW >Decent built-in mic and a jack (the sound quality is very good with the built-in mic) >Weather-proofing and dust-proofing >Quick cold starts and near-zero latency on the shutter",

				"text": "Long gone are the days where I had to lug a DSLR, multiple lenses and flashes in order to get good photos for clients. (I serve the construction market.) Enthusiast-level cameras do a great job and this one cost a fraction of what I spent on my last lens. While many clients are content with the photos they get from their iPhones, that's not what I want to deliver. In order to provide the quality I believe differentiates my services I need the control of a DSLR but I want the the compact size, low cost, and light weight of a great point-and-shoot.Here's what I love about this camera: >The ability to shoot shutter priority, aperture priority, full manual, or full auto (with consistently good results in auto) >Fast, quiet autofocus and zoom >Tilt and swivel touch-screen monitor >Very good 4k video >A decent built-in, variable-output flash and a hotshoe >The ability to shoot RAW >A decent built-in mic and a jack (the sound quality is very good with the built-in mic although production audio rarely makes it to the finish) >Quick cold starts and near-zero latency on the shutter The only thing I truly dislike is the thumbwheel focus. It's slow, badly placed, makes pull focus and follow focus nearly impossible (although the auto follow focus does a good job), and after a half-century of shooting I can't stop reaching for the barrel of the lens. I also wish they'd allocated costs differently. For some reason makers of enthusiast-level cameras think they need to pack their products with features that I find useless. Maybe their market demands these gimmicks but I hate 'em. Scene modes. Color balance. Drive modes. Then they slather on buttons and menus so that, in theory, you can access and manipulate all these options. I find them a hindrance. I wish they'd spent their money on a faster lens, a larger sensor, and better dynamic range. Overall I like this camera a lot and it will serve my commercial and personal needs very well. But it could be better, much better, with fewer frills. I've included some images from when I was first playing with the camera. The food shot from Patti's 1880s Settlement in Grand Rivers KY was shot at f2.8, 1/50, ISO 3200, no flash, in Intelligent Auto. The shot of Cave Run Lake (KY) was at f4, 1/320, ISO 100, Intelligent Auto. The picture of the church in downtown Kingsport, TN was shot at f2.8, 1/20, ISO 4000 in Intelligent Auto.",

				"text": "I bought the FZ300 as a present for my wife. She loved the FZ150 she was using but found it's limitations discouraging. She didn't want my FZ200 and didn’t like the FZ1000 I bought her at first because it was too big and heavy . I ended up adding it to my camera collection (it's a great 5 star camera that I enjoy using and I highly recommend). The FZ300 is smaller and lighter than the FZ1000 and seemed like a good upgrade for her to use. Before I gave my wife the camera I tested the camera out and was extremely impressed with the huge number of improvements in the camera over the FZ200. The FZ200 has the same lens and sensor as the FZ300 but the difference that the improved processor, much better EVF and touch screen, much better build quality, weather proofing make this camera a terrific buy. There are so many other features, neither of us has tried will make this camera useful for just about any occasion She likes to use just the IA setting like many users and the FZ300 works just perfect in that setting. She used the camera on our just completed cruise and was so enthusiast about it's performance, I kept hearing , \"I love this camera\", . \"I love this camera\". . In viewing her images they were coming out sharp, detailed, and perfect exposure. We were both amazed that even the lower light indoors images and video showed great detail. I set a 1600 ISO limit and images showed very good dynamic range, much better than the FZ200 I had used previously. The best features she liked were the beautiful bright sharp EVF, the fast accurate focus and the touch screen was a WOW, She also loved the many extra features. She found the handling superb. It does feel great in the hand and the new styling matches the newer Panasonic cameras. The menus are easy and the super control panel seen on expensive cameras is terrific. You can quickly adjust any setting on the LCD without going through extensive menus like most cameras. The touch focus on the LCD screen is also a great feature. Macro images are also much easier to take and look great. Some really great points and extra features that make the camera very special 1. The camera has an excellent grip, it feels good in the hands. Easy to use. 2. Very good camera build, feels more solid than the excellent FZ200 3. Camera has weather sealing and can be used in inclement weather. Not waterproof! 4. Great zoom range. From 25 to 600 5. EVF is larger and improved over FZ200 and can view scenes and info better 6. Touchscreen LCD is a great improvement which allows easier use of camera 7. Can set the focus point while viewing through EVF, focus area, extra functions buttons. 8. Constant F2.8 aperture throughout the entire zoom area. Allows more light, better low light 9. Has mechanical shutter (quiet) and electronic shutter (noise free) great in museums 10. Extremely fast focus, much improved over the FZ200. Depth from defocus process? 11. 4K photos, 30FPS images come out 8mp, can easily select perfect photo on LCD 12. 4K video now possible. Carefully done and results are excellent. 13. Camera appears very fast. Fast startup and ready to use. 14. Microphone port allows adding external Microphone. Useful when windy conditions. 15. Improved low light images even with the small sensor. Up to 1600 with some noise 16. Camera while small dSLR sized is fairly light even with the big zoom lens. 17. Can easily add filters, including Polarizers, ND filters and super closeup filters 18. Includes a very good lens hood that can protect the lens without adding a UV filter 19. Image quality is excellent in good light, shows good dynamic range and lots of detail. 20. Wifi allows easy transfer of images. And camera control through app. 21. Images and video overall is excellent with lots of keepers. 22. F2.8 constant aperture lens allows improved Bokeh (background blur not usually possible with small sensor.). Mostly seen in macro images. 23. Good quality macro images possible. What isn’t so great with this excellent camera and could be improved. 1. Camera uses a very small sensor, so low light images and video are limited 2. Small sensor has lower dynamic range and less detail in images. 3. Could use a headphone jack for video. 4. Missing extra wide angle because of fixed lens. 5. Not pocket able, so camera needs a bag or strap. 6. Low light images and video while tops for small sensor are still limited and can be noisy. 7. Lens is integrated in camera so you really can’t change the lens. 8. Camera is not inexpensive but considering all the features, it’s a good buy. If you love super zoom cameras or you are a birder, this is a must buy. It won't replace the FZ1000 which has a much larger 1 inch sensor with better image quality, better low light quality and better dynamic range. But the FZ300 is a true super zoom; it stands in a class all it's own and it is well worth upgrading if you have a FZ150/FZ200 or other older Canon or Nikon super zoom. Right now as of 2016, it's the best small sensor super zoom you can buy. If the camera seems too big or expensive for you, consider the Panasonic ZS50 which is a great pocket super zoom with an EVF or the new ZS100 which now has a 1 inch sensor and touchscreen EVF..but costs more than the FZ300..",

				"text": "I purchased this camera as an upgrade from the A6000 and I really enjoy it as both an upgrade and on its own merits. For those upgrading from an older Sony camera, the biggest new features are a touchscreen, effortless Eye AF, and Real-Time Tracking. The touchscreen is great for repositioning your Eye-AF point quickly, allowing you to tap or drag a finger across the back LCD. This functionality is available viewing the LCD or EVF and is a huge step up from the old four-way directional pad. The upgraded Sony Eye-AF is incredible and allows you to focus on composition without worrying about where your camera is focused. Lastly, Real-Time Tracking allows you to pick a moving subject and hold onto them like glue. On its own, I feel like this is a great travel camera. I can fit the 18-135mm zoom, 35mm prime, and 10-18mm zoom in a very small bag and carry them all day with ease on a hike or through a crowded city. The image quality is quite good without the bulk and weight of a larger camera. There are only a few downsides to this device. I wish that Sony had included a joystick and another exposure dial in the design to allow for even better control. Sony only included a slow UHS-I card slot, and the camera takes FOREVER to clear its buffer. Lastly, Sony did not fit IBIS into this model, instead reserving the feature for their future top-of-the-line A6600. Overall, I love this camera for travel!",

So don't be like me and get scared if you saw some greenish pictures indoor, maybe is because you are in a room whit fluorescent light, but if you increase your shutter speed, that problem goes away. In the outdoors my camera works well. Seems that the problem is with the artificial light. If you are an amateur like me, Be sure to use an OSS sony lens. First post: I was waiting so much for my camera and now I’m so sad... I don’t know why it is taking pictures tainted green ... the camera arrive today and I don’t know what to do... I also try whit another lens (a new sigma 30 mm 1.4) and is the same green tint in the pictures.",

				"text": "I have owned the a6400 for 10 days now since the day it started shipping. I have tested AF, Tracking, low light high ISO performance of this camera. The AF accuracy seems to be fantastic and very accurate in AF-C mode without tracking. If you can nail the focus then the pictures render a 3D pop in them. In tracking mode it is accurate but is not blazing fast (You can still get a high keeper rate more than 80%). I also own an A9 and native lenses as well as adapted lenses. I compare the two cameras and I can honestly say the a6400 even though 1/4th the price of an A9 is 50% close performance wise to an A9. The 2 pictures on the street(bus and car) were me testing the AF tracking and it seems pretty good for the first try within hours I received the camera without much fiddling into the settings. The third one is indoor with ISO 3200 and all of them are Straight out of the camera untouched. There is no IBIS in this camera but my lenses have OS or IS image stabilization and works very well. There is an Auto ISO feature which takes 3 pictures in rapid succession and combines them like an HDR image for you. I love this feature and it is awesome in low-light without a flash. The clear digital zoom is another feature that extends your lens range to double and is handy at times if you want that shot but lack the reach. for ex. if you have a lens that can zoom upto 200mm the clear zoom will make it 400 mm if you choose that option in menu settings. The learning curve on the Menu can be a little overwhelming but there are excellent tutorials to help you out. I personally like Mark Galers youtube channel. Just FYI. The ability to customize the menu is awesome for your taste. The menu and controls are on par and similar to an A9. The camera is growing on me definitely and 10 days later I love the camera even more. I will push it to the limits this spring and see how it performs. I am almost confident that I will not be disappointed. I come from canon after being 15 years loyal to them and I still use canon lenses. I believe Sony gives more value for your money at-least in their camera lineup. Edit: Added one more image and the battery life is also pretty good.",

I was considering the FDR-AX700 camcorder but when I saw the video recording capabilities of the a6400, it seemed like the right choice, mainly because it is much less expensive than the AX700 and smaller. But what really convinced me was that it does not shut down after only a few minutes of recording as the other alpha models and it has no recording lenght limit. Other great new features are the upgraded eye autofocus and the ability to power it directly via the micro USB port. Finally, image quality is deffinuteky better than the a6000. I can finally use ISO higher than 1600 knowing my images will look good. And lastly, I really like the silent shutter. It is something I really need sometimes snd now I have it.",

				"text": "Best Camera on the Market including all brands for the price and what you get. Hands down, just give up your money. I've owned the Nikon D3300, the Sony a6000, the Sony A7R, and even went BACK to crop sensor because of the price and features that this camera offers. If I had the money i would buy the A7iii but because I'm on a budget like most people here, this was the best photography purchase that I have made to contribute to my career. as a photographer. Best 3 Features in my opinion: Sony's Unmatched Realtime Eye-AF The Stupid fast AF for both Photo and Video Weight and Usability and Customizability! My favorite Setup so far is the a6400 + Sony 85mm 1.8(127.5mm Effective Crop Sensor) or the Sigma 16mm 1.4 (21mm Effective Crop Sensor). So practically getting a 24mm and a 135mm with an amazing body! Just add the flash of your choice!(I'm a portrait Photographer)",

				"text": "I'm a semi-professional photographer and I always jump on the chance to review cameras because I love them. This one is such a unique product that I'm really excited about it. My review will mainly be a comparison of whether or not you should get this camera (the Sony ZV-1) as opposed to a DSLR or even smart phone. *DO NOT get this camera if your main interest is still photographs. If you want still photographs then the DSLR is what you want. This camera has the added perk of taking photos, but the main focus of this is video content sharing. *The highlight of this camera is the ease of use. You really don't need to know technical things like which aperture to choose, which ISO or shutter speed, it does everything for you. It has auto focus (which is much better than on DSLRs) and the flip screen makes it easy to monitor yourself while you're recording. *The size of this makes it far superior to a DSLR. This thing is *tiny* and so lightweight. If you get the accessory kit with the wireless grip/tripod, you are good to go. This is especially good if you vlog while walking or need to be active when speaking to the camera. *Has slow-mo capability, time-lapse, bluetooth and wifi. *Benefits over just a regular 'ol smartphone: The image sensor on this is much bigger and better. With image sensors, the adage is \"the bigger the better\" which is why DSLR cameras have such an advantage (but they're also too big to lug around) This makes your image quality much higher. The microphone on this is also way better too. (With the DSLR, you would need to buy a separate mic.) You are free to buy a separate mic with this camera as well but the mic that it comes with is pretty good right out of the box. *Things that could be improved: The software it comes with is rather limited. Especially for editing videos, though on the plus side, you may not need to do too much editing if you are the type that just does your vlogging in one continuous take. *The lenses are built in/ not interchangeable. This is good in that you have everything you need at all times, but bad if you scratched/cracked your lens you would need to buy a whole new camera. *There's no flash - this shouldn't be an issue for vloggers though. Just wanted to mention in case someone was still thinking of getting this solely for still photography. *The battery life was middling. It wasn't great but I've seen other cameras perform worse. If you feel like you're going to be having long sessions, I would consider getting a second battery just in case. Overall, I think this is a great and versatile camera for those who vlog or create video content. The price is higher so you can buy a DSLR at this price point, however if you're not into technical things or would rather something more user friendly then this is definitely the route to take.",

				"text": "Let me start out by saying that I've used dozens of cameras over the past few years as a bit of a gear head. I've had full frame DSLRs, full frame mirrorless, APS-C options, micro 4/3's, etc. Most recently I had the Fuji X100V. Having a growing family I realized that while I love taking pictures of my kids growing up, what really captures the interest of everyone is capturing videos. I could take 1,000 pictures from a family trip and the things that the family will want to see is the video, not the pictures. For this I realized that having a more compelling video option was needed. In addition having a 7 year old girl, she's starting to want to make her own videos, which I post to her private YT channel. Pros - Having a compact option with a decently fast lens. The lens could be wider, it could be longer. There's a lot of could haves. Why not ask for a 12-500 mm lens? For what it is, it's a good compromise, has a decent enough range and fast lens, which is needed for a 1\" sensor. The 24-200 would've been too slow to shoot indoors without an external light. - The front flip screen. It makes talking head videos easier to shoot, putting it on a tripod and still having a hot/cold shoe for an external mic or a light source is fantastic. - Button layout. Having a record button, having a tally light are great. Cons - I would've loved to see a better use of a touch screen interface. Canon has it right for the most part, Sony could be much better. - I would've loved to have a mode dial and/or more front dials. But given a choice between what we have in the ZV-1 or a larger body/more expensive model, I'm ok with what we have. Things to note No, the stabilization is not the best. On standard it's not great. On active it's better but crops in. This is why I say for certain types of vlogging, like on a tripod or talking head video it's fine. If you're expecting to walk around and talk to yourself, you'll want to invest in a gimbal. No, the battery isn't the best. Luckily they're tiny and you can find plenty of generic options. No, you don't get a charger in the box. Most cameras these days are not shipping with one. No you won't get the ultra thin depth of field from this, it's a 1\" sensor, there are limitations. For the price, the size, the features, it's the best option that I've found at the present time. It's not perfect, but any camera enthusiast will tell you that there isn't. It's about weighing the positives and the negatives and find the one with the most plusses and the least amount of negatives for your needs. Think about it, if the perfect camera existed, you'd have no compelling reason to upgrade to the next model, so in a way you have to think that manufacturers intentionally withhold a little here and a little there.",

The internal mic is no good, AND THERE’S NO CONTINUOUS SHOOTING LIKE THEY CLAIM! The video is broken down into 10 minute files... NOT 1 continuous video file. The audio is defective.. sometimes it doesn’t work and when it does there’s a hissing and strange white noise in the background that pulsates with my voice as I talk. Sounds like ocean waves. Even in a silent room with no wind AND using the dead cat. The picture quality is wonderful! Plus the smooth skin effect makes you look better. ONLY buy for those 2 reasons. What I dislike most are the claims by Sony that this camera is capable of continuous recording without limits. THAT IS NOT ALL THE WAY TRUE. The video is broken down into individual 10 minute video files as you “continuously” record. I contacted support and they said once it reaches 2GB a new file is created.",
